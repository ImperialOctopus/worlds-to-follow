# Arts

## Pattern

### Information

Gain information about your surroundings. Magically enhanced senses. Synthetic senses.

### Distortion

The senses deceive us from time to time, and it is prudent never to trust wholly those who have deceived us even once.

### Control

Influence thoughts. Shape wills. Never take "no" for an answer. Erase, re-write, believe.

### Contact

Send and receive information across distances. Talk to strange beings. Talk to regular beings.

## Applied

### Microkinetics

Manipulate atomic motion. Fire, ice, electricity, pressure. Explode first, ask questions later.

### Macrokinetics

Manipulate motion on an object scale. Pick things up. Put things down. Move things around. Fly.

### Protection

Dissipate the force of incoming attacks. The only way to avoid harm if you value staying human.

### Projection

Create temporary objects from magic. Raise a wall, raise a staircase, raise a blade.

## Materials

### Transformation

Transfigure water into wine, and vice versa. Do the same with lead, gold, chickens, or eggs.

### Trace

The foundation of modern magic. Burn magic into wood, stone, and flesh.

### Acceleration

Speed up, slow down. Skirt the edges of causality. Time is a river; sink to the bottom.

### Spellbreak

Read and understand magic. Undo it. Interrupt, redirect and disperse. Stay on your guard.

## Otherwhere

### Transposition

Move things from one place to another without consulting all the places in between.

### Summoning

Bring things into the world that exist elsewhere. Give form to things without form. Walk across the Arc-en-Ciel.

### Interdiction

Counter-summon. Deny para-causality. Cling desperately. Walk through the valley of the shadow of death, and fear.

### Life

Pull things back from other places. Build, rebuild. Grow, regrow. Transgress the natural order.
