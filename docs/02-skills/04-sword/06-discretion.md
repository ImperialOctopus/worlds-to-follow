# Discretion

Keep quiet.

Stay still. Stay hidden. Hold your tongue and hold your breath, and wait for the perfect opportunity.

Those skilled in Discretion:

- Hide in plain sight.
- Are not overheard.
- Know when not to speak, or act.

## 1: Hide

<AbilityCard
speed="action"
title="Hide"
subtitle="Mundane ability"
parameters={["Speed: Action."]}>
You hide from creatures that are aware of you but aren't able to see you (or detect you with another sense). Roll Discretion vs. Awareness for all of them. Creatures that fail stop being aware of your location.
</AbilityCard>

## 3: Steganography

<AbilityCard
speed="ritual"
title="Steganography"
subtitle="Mundane ability"
parameters={["Speed: Ritual."]}>
You hide a secret message within another, innocuous, message. Only creatures with a Discretion higher than yours notice its presence, unless they are told that a hidden message is present. Anyone who knows the message is there may roll Discretion vs. yours to decipher it. You may share your techniques with other creatures, allowing them to decipher your messages without rolling.
