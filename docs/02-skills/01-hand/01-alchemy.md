See the [Potions](/potions) section of the guide to see a list of potions you can create, and for more information about how potion effects work.

## 1: Administer

<AbilityCard
speed="action"
title="Administer"
subtitle="Mundane ability"
parameters={["Speed: Action.", "Range: Touch.", "Target: Creature."]}>
Choose a potion in your possession to administer to the affected creature. The creature gains the potion's effect. If the creature already has its maximum number of active potions, it loses one of its choice before gaining the new effect.

You can try to affect an unwilling creature with Alchemy vs. Endurance. The potion is still consumed even if you fail. If the potion you administer replaces an existing potion effect it loses the oldest effect instead of one of its choice.

<AbilityCard
speed="ritual"
title="Potion Engineering"

parameters={["Speed: Ritual."]}>
Create a potion from a potion formula you know (with a maximum level of your Alchemy). You learn two potion sets from the Potion Formulae list, and gain one extra potion set of your choice when you reach 5, 7, and 9 Alchemy.
