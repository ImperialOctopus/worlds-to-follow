- Know about magic which alters the body.

See the [Potions](/potions) section of the guide to see a list of potions you can create, and for more information about how potion effects work.

## 1: Administer

<AbilityCard
speed="action"
title="Administer"
subtitle="Mundane ability"
parameters={["Speed: Action.", "Range: Touch.", "Target: Creature."]}>
Affect an unwilling creature with Alchemy vs. Endurance. Choose a potion in your possession to administer; the potion is consumed, even if it fails to affect the creature. The creature gains the potion's effect. If the creature already has its maximum number of active potions, it loses one of its choice before gaining the new effect (if the creature was unwilling, it instead loses the oldest).
</AbilityCard>

<AbilityCard
speed="ritual"
title="Potion Engineering"

Create a potion from a potion formula you know (with a maximum level of your Alchemy). You learn two sets of potion formulae from the Potion Formulae list, and gain one extra when you reach 5, 7, and 9 Alchemy.
