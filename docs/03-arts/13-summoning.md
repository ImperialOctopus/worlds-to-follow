# Summoning

Bring things into the world that exist elsewhere. Give form to things without form. Walk across the Arc-en-Ciel.

## Summon Familiar

<AbilityCard
speed="ritual"
title="Summon Familiar"
subtitle="Summoning spell"
parameters={["Speed: Ritual.", "Range: 10 m.", "Cost: 2."]}>
Summons your bound familiar, giving it a physical body in the plane you are on. If your familiar is already summoned, this allows you to change its form. If you give it form, it appears at a location of your choice within range; if you change its form, it disappears (wherever it is), and reappears at a location of your choice within range.
Your familiar's form may have any appearance of your choice, with a size up to 20 cm in any dimension.
Your familiar's form has half as many total skill points as you (rounded up), distributed as you wish, with a maximum of 3 in any skill.

You have a telepathic connection with your familiar while it is summoned, allowing you to communicate with it (this effect counts as Contact magic).

speed="ritual"
title="Bind Familiar"
subtitle="Summoning spell"

Binds a tame animal or a willing Outsider as your familiar.

If you choose an Outsider, it might provide you with some benefit or impart some cost on you.

You can only have one familiar at a time; if you bind a new one, any previous familiar you have is released. You can also cast this spell with no target to release your bound familiar.
