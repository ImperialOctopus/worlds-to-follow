## Flexible Projection

<AbilityCard
speed="action"
title="Flexible Projection"
subtitle="Projection spell"
parameters={["Speed: Action.", "Range: 10 m.", "Area: Cube (Expression × 0.5 m).", "Cost: 2.", "Concentration."]}>
Create an object made of magic that lasts until this spell ends. The object must fit entirely within this spell's Area when you create it, but doesn't have to remain within it.

The object may:

- Have any shape you like, of one continuous volume.
- Have any appearance you like; it cannot be invisible, but may be as transparent as glass.
- Be either mobile, or fixed in place.
- Be any weight, ranging in density from air to stone.

The object cannot be damaged or broken. It cannot cause damage to anything by itself (e.g. by falling), but could be used by a creature for an attack if appropriate (e.g. a sword). The object is not real, and can't hold trace.

Especially complicated objects may require an Expression roll.

- If a creature moves 3 m or more through the object on its turn, roll Expression vs. its Prowess. If it fails, it loses one action (on its next turn if it has none remaining this turn).

You can choose to have insubstantial objects you create cover a surface. If you do, the spell's Area is doubled, but it can only be a few millimetres thick across the surface. It can hinder creatures moving across it.
