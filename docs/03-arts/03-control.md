# Control

Influence thoughts. Shape wills. Never take "no" for an answer. Erase, re-write, believe.

## Command

<AbilityCard
speed="action"
title="Command"
subtitle="Control spell"
parameters={["Speed: Action.", "Range: 10 m.", "Target: Creature.", "Cost: 3."]}>
You give the target a simple physical instruction of a few words (e.g. attack this creature, run over there) which it must follow on its next turn, if able. If the target believes the instruction you give it will directly cause it harm, this spell has no effect. Affect an unwilling creature with Presence vs. Depths.
</AbilityCard>

### Endless Order

_Prerequisite: Composure 4_

<AbilityCard
speed="enhancement"
title="Endless Order"
subtitle="Spell enhancement">
When you cast Command, you may choose to concentrate on it, maintaining your instruction indefinitely. If you do, you must use an action on each of your turns to maintain control over the targets by rolling Presence vs. their Depths. The spell ends on targets which win the roll. If you end your turn without attempting to reassert control, the spell ends.
</AbilityCard>

### Subconscious Control

_Prerequisite: Composure 6_

<AbilityCard
speed="enhancement"
title="Subconscious Control"
subtitle="Spell enhancement">
When you concentrate on Command, you gain an extra action on each of your turns that you may only use to reassert control.

</AbilityCard>

### Modify Mind

_Prerequisite: Composure 4, Depths 6_

<AbilityCard
speed="enhancement"
title="Modify Mind"
subtitle="Spell enhancement">
When you cast Command, the instruction you give may be up to a single sentence long. It is not limited to purely physical instructions (e.g. you may order a creature to answer your questions truthfully), but must be something the creature could consciously choose to do.

</AbilityCard>

### Domination

_Prerequisite: Presence 4_

<AbilityCard
speed="enhancement"
title="Domination"
subtitle="Spell enhancement">
When you cast Command, the target may not do anything on its turn that you do not wish it to do, regardless of the instruction you give.
</AbilityCard>

## Stun

_Prerequisite: Presence 4, Prowess 4_

<AbilityCard
speed="attack"
title="Stun"
subtitle="Control spell"
parameters={["Speed: Attack.", "Range: 5 m.", "Target: Creature.", "Cost: 2."]}>

## Revoke Will

_Prerequisite: Presence 6_

<AbilityCard
speed="attack"
title="Revoke Will"
subtitle="Control spell"
parameters={["Speed: Attack.", "Range: 5 m.", "Target: Creature.", "Cost: 6.", "Concentration."]}>
You issue an instruction to the affected creature which it obeys without question. The creature is not consciously aware of your order, even if it is aware that you cast a spell on it.
The instruction is limited only by what the creature is capable of — including, but not limited to:

- Altering the creature's memory, or causing it to accurately recall events in far greater detail than it could consciously.
- Giving arbitrarily complex instructions.
- Causing the creature to experience some imaginary sensation, lose the ability to speak, or immediately die.

Affect an unwilling creature with Presence vs. Depths.
</AbilityCard>

### Diadem

_Prerequisite: Presence 8_

<AbilityCard
speed="enhancement"
title="Diadem"
subtitle="Spell enhancement">
When you cast Revoke Will, you do not need to concentrate. The spell is immediately traced into the affected creature, without rendering the creature helpless. It does not count against its maximum number of traces, and its cost is zero.
</AbilityCard>

## Enchant

_Prerequisite: Performance 2_

<AbilityCard
speed="action"
title="Enchant"
subtitle="Control spell"
parameters={["Speed: Action.", "Range: 5 m.", "Target: Creature.", "Cost: 2.", "Concentration."]}>
You subtly influence the affected creature's mind. This spell cannot affect a creature that you are fighting; if an affected creature takes damage, this spell ends on it. Affect an unwilling creature with Presence vs. Depths.
