# Distortion

The senses deceive us from time to time, and it is prudent never to trust wholly those who have deceived us even once.

## Create Image

Speed: Action.
Range: 3 m.
Target: Location or Object.
Cost: 2.
Concentration.

Creates an illusory image of a single object at the target location. The image may be as simple or complex as you like, and can be animated as you wish. The image cannot be larger than 1 m in any dimension. The illusion is visual only; it produces no sound or other sensory information, and other objects pass through it.
This spell can target objects, in which case the illusion originates from the object and moves with it.

### Illusion Motility

### Astral Projection

### Audio Synthesis

_Prerequisite: Performance 2_

When you cast a Distortion spell that creates an illusion, the spell can produce sound. It may be as complex as you like, and as loud as you like. The sound is not real, and therefore cannot damage listeners or nearby objects. In the case of Disguise, the spell can hide sound (e.g. the sound of heavy boots) as well as create new sounds (e.g. to disguise the creature's voice) to be consistent with the disguise appearance.

### Reality of Perception

_Prerequisite: Performance 2_

When you cast a Distortion spell that creates an illusion, the spell can simulate any kind of sensory information. Creatures touching the illusion feel it as solid, but can pass through it if they try. In the case of Disguise, the spell can hide any sensory information to be consistent with the disguise appearance.

### Mislead

### Persistent Shadow

_Prerequisite: Performance 2_

When you cast Invisibility, if an affected creature takes an attack action or casts a spell, Invisibility doesn't end on it. Instead, the creature becomes visible until the start of its next turn.
If you are invisible due to Mislead, the same applies; attacking or casting a spell causes you to become visible until the start of your next turn.
