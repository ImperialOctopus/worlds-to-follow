# Metamagic

## Introduction

Personal Reality represents your ability to project your will onto the world around you — rules be damned. Through Metamagic, you can twist your spells to do things they were never designed to.

You gain one Metamagic from the list below (that you qualify for) when you reach 3, 5, 7, and 9 Personal Reality. You can also replace any Metamagics you know with any others that you qualify for whenever you gain a point in Personal Reality.

When you cast a spell, choose any Metamagics that you have to apply to it. They can be applied to any spell, regardless of its Art.

**Skill Requirements (Blue)**: Some Metamagic options have a skill requirement which you must meet to be able to take them — these, like Art prerequisites, refer to your base skill before any temporary increases or decreases (i.e. you do not lose access to gated Metamagics if the prerequisite skills are temporarily decreased).

**Signature Metamagic (Gold)**: Some Metamagics are marked as "signature". You can only have one signature Metamagic.
