# Creating a Character

Creating a character in this game requires the following decisions:

- Assigning skill points.
- Choosing your starting [Arts](/arts).
- Choosing any [Potion Formulae](/potions), [Artistries](/artistry), and [Metamagic](/metamagic) you might start with.
- Choosing any languages you start with, and other setting-dependent decisions (e.g. place of origin, occupation).

## Skills

12 points to distribute between the four categories. Minimum of 1 in each. Max of 5. Points give 1 point to each skill in the category.
Skills are divided into four categories:

- The Pen (Personal Reality, Arts, Depths, Presence, Empathy, Spirituality)
- The Paper (Medicine, Encyclopaedia, Visualisation, Arcane, Reason, Politics).
- The Hand (Alchemy, World, Composure, Endurance, Prowess, Energetics).
- The Sword (Performance, Reflexes, Elegance, Awareness, Precision, Discretion).

Each character has 12 points to distribute as they like between these four categories, representing the lessons learned in their life before the story begins. Each skill starts at a level equal to the category's score.

Each category must have a minimum of 1 point, and a maximum of 5.

## Languages

All languages in your setting will be divided into _common_ and _specialist_ languages. Common languages are those spoken in or around the area you're in, or languages you are likely to come into contact with. Specialist languages are those from far-away countries, dead languages, and other languages that require uncommon training to learn.

You cannot usually learn specialist languages without at least 5 in Encyclopaedia; if your character is from a foreign country or would otherwise have come into contact with a specialist character before the story starts, ask your Arbiter if it would be appropriate for you to start with a specialist language.
