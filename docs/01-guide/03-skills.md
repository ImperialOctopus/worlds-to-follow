# Skills and Abilities

### Skill Abilities

#### Temporary Skill Changes

Some effects temporarily reduce your skills. These reductions last until you next rest. You retain any unlocked skill abilities even if the relevant skill is reduced below the required value for that perk. Similarly, any temporary skill increases last until you next rest, and do not unlock new skill abilities. Skills cannot be increased above 10 or reduced below 1.
Any abilities which require you to lose points in a skill cannot be used if the reduction would reduce the skill below 1.
