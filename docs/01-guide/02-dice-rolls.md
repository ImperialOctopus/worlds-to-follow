# Dice Rolls and Entitlement

## Skill Rolls

Players should propose rolls when their characters take actions outside of the normal; they explain the action they wish their character to take, and suggest an applicable skill. The Arbiter has final say on what skills are appropriate, and decides the difficulty of the roll. Some rolls are called for by the Arbiter (e.g. observe details about the environment or resist the effects of a spell).

:::warning Key Point

Skill rolls are rolled _before_ narrating the relevant action (e.g. roll, and then decide what exactly you say to attempt to persuade someone). Players should narrate the consequences, good or bad, of rolls that they propose. The Arbiter will usually narrate the consequences of rolls they call for.

### Calculating Rolls

Rolls are calculated as: 2d6 + score. Compare with the roll's difficulty (usually determined by the Arbiter). A roll greater than or equal to the difficulty succeeds.

Contested rolls are described as "Offence vs. Defence". Offence represents the more "active" side, attempting to change the state of things. Defence, on the other hand, represents the side resisting change.

To determine which side is which, use this guide:

- If a character used an ability which calls for the roll, they're Offence.
- If a player proposed a roll, they're Offence.
- If you're not sure, the player characters default to Offence.

In the case of a tie, Offence wins.

### Critical Hits / Misses

This game has no critical hits or misses.

### Edge

If you have an edge on a roll, roll an extra d6 on top of the usual two. If you have more than one edge on a roll from different sources, each one gives you an extra d6. Keep the highest two d6s from all those that you roll.

## Entitlement

When the abilities and spells described in these rules state that they cause some effect, that doesn't mean precisely what is described happens; it means that the player is _entitled_ to that effect. This means that they may choose any effect for that ability or spell when they use it, _up to and including_ exactly what is described. For example, a spell that entitles the player to one square metre of fire may be used to create a candle flame; a torch flame; or an entire solid cube, one metre on a side - but not more.
For spells and abilities that require concentration, you may change its effect (within its limits) as long as it lasts.
