# Spells and Traces

## Spell Descriptions

### Speed

### Range

### Target

### Subject

### Cost

### Concentration

## Magic

When you cast a spell, you may apply any of the orange spell enhancements that you have (i.e. that you have the prerequisite skills for). You don't have to apply any at all, and each spell you cast can use different enhancements.

### Unwritten Information

Spell descriptions will always include Speed, Range, and Target.
If spell descriptions are missing information, assume the following:

- Cost: 0.
- Not concentration.
- Attack speed spells assume a target of "Creature or Object".
  If a spell doesn't specify a way for an unwilling creature to avoid its effects, it can't target unwilling creatures at all.

### Range

Spells with a range of Self can target only the caster. They are not affected by spell enhancements that would increase their range.
Spells with a range of Touch can only affect targets adjacent to the caster, and require physical contact (they cannot be used if the caster cannot move). Touch spells can be thought of as "0 m", and are increased by enhancements that add range; if their range is increased, they are no longer Touch range.

### Concentration

Some spells or abilities require concentration; you can't start new concentration abilities if you don't have space to concentrate on them. You can only concentrate on one thing at a time (although some abilities increase this). You can stop concentrating whenever you like, and that effect immediately ends.
When you take damage, roll Composure vs. 12. If you fail, you lose concentration on everything you're concentrating on.

### Mana

At the start of your turn, you gain an amount of mana equal to your Energetics. Unspent mana is lost at the start of your next turn.
Some spells specify a mana cost to cast. You must pay that much mana when you cast them; if you don't have enough, you can't cast that spell.
Spells with a cost of "X" are variable cost; you choose a value for X when you cast them. Any effects that reduce the cost of your spells apply after you choose X, and do not reduce the value of X for the spell's effects.

### Detect Magic

Magic leaves a trace on any objects or creatures affected by it that can be seen with the Detect Magic ability. The traces can be used to identify:

- The Art of the magic
- Whether the magic is still ongoing, or has ended
- If ended, how long ago the magic ended (to a precision of about an hour; the traces fade completely after 48 hours)

### Circle Magic

## Trace Magic

Traces are a kind of permanent spell affecting creatures or objects without requiring concentration.
Player characters all start with one trace, called Spellcasting, which allows them to cast spells. If they ever lose this trace, they cannot use any of their magic. Spellcasting counts towards their total, leaving most characters with two available traces.

- Creatures may hold a maximum of three traces at once.
- All player characters start with the Spellcasting _trace_, which allows them to perform magic, and counts towards their limit.
  Objects can be affected by between one and three traces, depending on their make-up:
- Objects made from non-biological materials (e.g. metal, stone) can hold one trace.
- Objects made from materials that were once alive (e.g. wood, leather) can hold two.
- Objects made from fossilised material (e.g. amber, jet) can hold three.
  Objects made from a mixture of materials should use the lower number, unless the inclusion of that material is purely ornamental. For example, both a metal-tipped spear with a wooden handle and a steel sword would hold one trace each. A pair of leather gloves with golden adornment would hold two traces, however, as the gold doesn't contribute to the function of the object.

### Inactive Traces

When a spell traced into a creature would end, it instead becomes inactive. Inactive traces can still be detected, but otherwise do nothing, and have costs of zero (restoring lost Energetics to traced characters). Inactive traces become active again when the character rests.
Spells traced into objects do not become inactive; they simply disappear if their spell ends.

### Trace Mana Cost

Traced spells do not consume mana the same way concentration spells do: instead, they each reduce your Energetics by their cost. Traced spells with variable cost keep the same value for X that they were cast with. This reduction cannot be avoided or removed, except by removing the trace. You still use your base Energetics for accessing skill abilities or spell enhancements, just like other temporary stat reductions.

- For each trace you have, reduce your Energetics by the cost of the spell.
  Objects have a maximum total cost for all spells traced into them equal to their total available traces (i.e. one for metal objects, two for wooden objects, etc.)
