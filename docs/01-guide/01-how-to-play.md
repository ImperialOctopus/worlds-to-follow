# 1: How to Play

## Basics

### Skill Rolls

Players should propose rolls when their characters take actions outside of the normal; they explain the action they wish their character to take, and suggest an applicable skill. The arbiter has final say on what skills are appropriate, and decides the difficulty of the roll. Some rolls are called for by the arbiter (e.g. observe details about the environment or resist the effects of a spell).
Key point: skill rolls are rolled _before_ narrating the relevant action (e.g. roll, and then decide what exactly you say to attempt to persuade someone). Players should narrate the consequences, good or bad, of rolls that they propose. The arbiter will usually narrate the consequences of rolls they call for.

### Calculating Rolls

Rolls are calculated as: 2d6 + score. Compare with the roll's difficulty (usually determined by the arbiter). A roll greater than or equal to the difficulty succeeds.
Contested rolls are described as "Offence vs. Defence". The character taking the action (the one with the ability describing the roll) is rolling offence, and their target is defence. In the case of a tie, offence wins.

### Edge

If you have an edge on a roll, roll an extra d6, and take the highest 2d6 from your pool. Multiple edges on the same roll stack.

### Entitlement

Many abilities and spells will specify a player is entitled to certain effects. This means that they may choose any effect for that ability or spell when they use it, _up to and including_ the what they are entitled to. For example, a spell that entitles the player to one square metre of fire may be used to create a candle flame; a torch flame; or an entire solid cube, one metre on a side - but not more.

### Skills

### Skill Abilities

#### Temporary Skill Changes

Some effects temporarily reduce your skills. These reductions last until you next rest. You retain any unlocked skill abilities even if the relevant skill is reduced below the required value for that perk. Similarly, any temporary skill increases last until you next rest, and do not unlock new skill abilities. Skills cannot be increased above 10 or reduced below 1.
Any abilities which require you to lose points in a skill cannot be used if the reduction would reduce the skill below 1.

## Combat

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all participants roll Awareness. Higher results act first.

### Movement

Character have a speed equal to 5 + Prowess. On their turn they may move up to their speed, split up as they like before, between, or after any Actions they take.

### Actions

Characters have two actions to use per turn. Attacks are a special type of action; characters may take at most one attack-speed action per turn. Actions could include throwing an item, attempting to see through a _distortion_ spell, or pressing a conspicuous button; they cannot deal damage to other creatures unless they are attacks.
Attacks always require a contested roll, unless you're attacking a willing creature or an object, and are entitled to deal 1 damage.

### Reactions

Some abilities or spells are Reaction speed. They do not take an Action to use, and do not have to be used on your turn. Rather, they will specify certain conditions that must be met. You have one Reaction to use, and regain it at the start of each of your turns.

### Damage

All attacks that deal damage are potentially lethal; Endurance measures a creature's ability to resist them (whether that be by dodging, or simply being very large!). When a creature takes damage, its Endurance falls by that much - unless its Endurance already was 1, in which case it is rendered helpless. (Note that a creature with 2 Endurance taking 2 damage would not be rendered helpless, as its Endurance was not 1 when it took damage).
If a creature is helpless, it can't avoid harm any more - if a helpless creature would take damage, the attacker is instead entitled to any of:

- Kill the creature
- Render the creature unconscious but stable
  Helpless creatures can't resist attacks or spells; this means they are automatically affected by spells without rolling defence, and can be affected by spells which cannot normally affect unwilling targets.

### Hiding

You can only target creatures or objects that you are aware of (spells that affect an area will still affect things in that area that you aren't aware of). You become aware of any creatures or objects that you can see, and become aware of any creatures that make a sound (e.g. running, casting a spell). The arbiter may ask you to roll Awareness to detect creatures making a subtle sound. If they are actively trying to hide, they may contest your roll with Discretion.
Once aware of a creature, you remain aware of it (even if it breaks line of sight) unless it successfully Hides from you.
Creatures that cannot see do not automatically become aware of creatures or objects within line of sight. Creatures that cannot hear do not remain aware of creatures they cannot see.

## Magic

When you cast a spell, you may apply any of the orange spell enhancements that you have (i.e. that you have the prerequisite skills for). You don't have to apply any at all, and each spell you cast can use different enhancements.

### Unwritten Information

Spell descriptions will always include Speed, Range, and Target.
If spell descriptions are missing information, assume the following:

- Cost: 0.
- Not concentration.
- Attack speed spells assume a target of "Creature or Object".
  If a spell doesn't specify a way for an unwilling creature to avoid its effects, it can't target unwilling creatures at all.

### Range

Spells with a range of Self can target only the caster. They are not affected by spell enhancements that would increase their range.
Spells with a range of Touch can only affect targets adjacent to the caster, and require physical contact (they cannot be used if the caster cannot move). Touch spells can be thought of as "0 m", and are increased by enhancements that add range; if their range is increased, they are no longer Touch range.

### Concentration

Some spells or abilities require concentration; you can't start new concentration abilities if you don't have space to concentrate on them. You can only concentrate on one thing at a time (although some abilities increase this). You can stop concentrating whenever you like, and that effect immediately ends.
When you take damage, roll Composure vs. 12. If you fail, you lose concentration on everything you're concentrating on.

### Mana

At the start of your turn, you gain an amount of mana equal to your Energetics. Unspent mana is lost at the start of your next turn.
Some spells specify a mana cost to cast. You must pay that much mana when you cast them; if you don't have enough, you can't cast that spell.
Spells with a cost of "X" are variable cost; you choose a value for X when you cast them. Any effects that reduce the cost of your spells apply after you choose X, and do not reduce the value of X for the spell's effects.

### Detect Magic

Magic leaves a trace on any objects or creatures affected by it that can be seen with the Detect Magic ability. The traces can be used to identify:

- The Art of the magic
- Whether the magic is still ongoing, or has ended
- If ended, how long ago the magic ended (to a precision of about an hour; the traces fade completely after 48 hours)

### Circle Magic

## Trace Magic

Traces are a kind of permanent spell affecting creatures or objects without requiring concentration.
Player characters all start with one trace, called Spellcasting, which allows them to cast spells. If they ever lose this trace, they cannot use any of their magic. Spellcasting counts towards their total, leaving most characters with two available traces.

- Creatures may hold a maximum of three traces at once.
- All player characters start with the Spellcasting _trace_, which allows them to perform magic, and counts towards their limit.
  Objects can be affected by between one and three traces, depending on their make-up:
- Objects made from non-biological materials (e.g. metal, stone) can hold one trace.
- Objects made from materials that were once alive (e.g. wood, leather) can hold two.
- Objects made from fossilised material (e.g. amber, jet) can hold three.
  Objects made from a mixture of materials should use the lower number, unless the inclusion of that material is purely ornamental. For example, both a metal-tipped spear with a wooden handle and a steel sword would hold one trace each. A pair of leather gloves with golden adornment would hold two traces, however, as the gold doesn't contribute to the function of the object.

### Inactive Traces

When a spell traced into a creature would end, it instead becomes inactive. Inactive traces can still be detected, but otherwise do nothing, and have costs of zero (restoring lost Energetics to traced characters). Inactive traces become active again when the character rests.
Spells traced into objects do not become inactive; they simply disappear if their spell ends.

### Trace Mana Cost

Traced spells do not consume mana the same way concentration spells do: instead, they each reduce your Energetics by their cost. Traced spells with variable cost keep the same value for X that they were cast with. This reduction cannot be avoided or removed, except by removing the trace. You still use your base Energetics for accessing skill abilities or spell enhancements, just like other temporary stat reductions.

- For each trace you have, reduce your Energetics by the cost of the spell.
  Objects have a maximum total cost for all spells traced into them equal to their total available traces (i.e. one for metal objects, two for wooden objects, etc.)

## Potions

### Using Potions

Drinking a potion takes an action. You can pass potions to other people as you could any item, but you cannot help them drink them.
You can only be affected by one potion at a time. If you drink more potions than you can have active, choose one to replace.
When you rest, you lose all your active potion effects.

## Helplessness

- Has no Actions on its turn
- Can't take Reactions
- Cannot concentrate on anything
- Can move by crawling, up to half its usual speed

### Unconscious

Creatures rendered unconscious are out of the fight; they can recover later at ritual speed, but cannot be revived quickly enough by any means (even healing) to contribute to a fight.
