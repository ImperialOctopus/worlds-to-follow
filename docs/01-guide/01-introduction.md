# Worlds to Follow

Hi there! Welcome to my weird little game! This is very much the game _I_ wanted to make, not necessarily a game I thought anyone would want to play... so if you enjoy it, let's be friends.

This game is _2d6 based_. Compared to d20 systems, this provides considerably less variance on your rolls: you'll be more consistently good at things your character is good at, and more consistently bad at things they're bad at.

This game is _magic first_. Every player character can cast spells, and I make no guarantee that non-magic-focused characters will feel as powerful or fun as spellcasters. I recommend that you create characters with some balance between physical ability and magical power.

This game is _classless_ - everyone can do a little bit of everything, including casting spells (your skills determine how good you are at whatever you try). If you want to follow the path of a traditional RPG class, go ahead — but if you want to branch out a bit, that's allowed too.

This game maintains _free flavour_. You should feel free to re-skin anything in the game's rules to fit whatever concept you have for your character or world; as long as you maintain the underlying mechanics of any feature you change, go nuts.

A few more notes before we start:

- This game has _no equipment_. All abilities in this game that use weapons can be used just as easily without them. Ranged attacks might use bows, rifles, or just rocks you find nearby!
- This game has _no blood loss_. In some games, health loss is supposed to represent physical damage taken by people. In this game, it doesn't — it represents your character's stamina being worn down.
- This game has _no carrying capacity_, no _survival rules_, no _map traversal speed_. All these things are completely setting dependent — some games won't need them, and some will add them on.
- This game's equivalent of the "game master" is referred to in these rules as _the Arbiter_. It's up to you whether your Arbiter will be a single player who doesn't have a character of their own (and controls all the NPCs), or you want to use some other model of play.

The game mechanics described here make as few assumptions as possible about your game's world; these are just the rules — the worlds are to follow.
