# Running a Game

## Session Zero

A session zero is a chat that your group has about an upcoming game that you have before actually starting it. They help get everyone on the same page about the game, and set up the game's boundaries.

Consider following this checklist for your session zero:

### Gameplay

- Character creation guidelines
- Starting level
- house rules

### World

- Defining characteristics
- main driver for the campaign
- major factions

### Safety

- player etiquette
- Safety tools

## The Arbiter

This game's equivalent of the "Game Master" or "Dungeon Master" is referred to as _the Arbiter_. The Arbiter looks after the world, plays non-player characters, sets the difficulty of rolls that the characters make, and otherwise guides the story of the game.

Traditionally, the role of Arbiter is taken by one player who doesn't create their own character, but you can fill the role however you like for your game. You might choose to switch the role between two or more players between story arcs, or not have a single Arbiter at all, making decisions about the world as a group. Make sure you talk about which system you're using in your session zero.

## The World

Compared to some other TTRPG systems, this one comes with very little assumed _world_. Part of the Arbiter's role is looking after the world around your characters. You might choose to use a pre-written setting, or create one of your own. You might improvise anything except the broadest point, or write your own encyclopaedia before starting. None of these choices are wrong, though you should set expectations with your group before starting.
