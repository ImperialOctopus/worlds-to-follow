# Fighting, and Dying

## Combat

### Initiative

At the start of combat, all participants roll Awareness. Higher results act first.

### Movement

Character have a speed equal to 5 + Prowess. On their turn they may move up to their speed, split up as they like before, between, or after any Actions they take.

### Actions

Characters have two actions to use per turn. Attacks are a special type of action; characters may take at most one attack-speed action per turn. Actions could include throwing an item, attempting to see through a _distortion_ spell, or pressing a conspicuous button; they cannot deal damage to other creatures unless they are attacks.
Attacks always require a contested roll, unless you're attacking a willing creature or an object, and are entitled to deal 1 damage.

### Reactions

Some abilities or spells are Reaction speed. They do not take an Action to use, and do not have to be used on your turn. Rather, they will specify certain conditions that must be met. You have one Reaction to use, and regain it at the start of each of your turns.

### Damage

All attacks that deal damage are potentially lethal; Endurance measures a creature's ability to resist them (whether that be by dodging, or simply being very large!). When a creature takes damage, its Endurance falls by that much - unless its Endurance already was 1, in which case it is rendered helpless. (Note that a creature with 2 Endurance taking 2 damage would not be rendered helpless, as its Endurance was not 1 when it took damage).
If a creature is helpless, it can't avoid harm any more - if a helpless creature would take damage, the attacker is instead entitled to any of:

- Kill the creature
- Render the creature unconscious but stable
  Helpless creatures can't resist attacks or spells; this means they are automatically affected by spells without rolling defence, and can be affected by spells which cannot normally affect unwilling targets.

## Awareness

### Hiding

You can only target creatures or objects that you are aware of (spells that affect an area will still affect things in that area that you aren't aware of). You become aware of any creatures or objects that you can see, and become aware of any creatures that make a sound (e.g. running, casting a spell). The arbiter may ask you to roll Awareness to detect creatures making a subtle sound. If they are actively trying to hide, they may contest your roll with Discretion.
Once aware of a creature, you remain aware of it (even if it breaks line of sight) unless it successfully Hides from you.
Creatures that cannot see do not automatically become aware of creatures or objects within line of sight. Creatures that cannot hear do not remain aware of creatures they cannot see.

### Casting a Spell

Casting a spell doesn't require to you speak, but it does always give away your location with sound. You might have your character speak magic words, but you could equally choose for the magic to produce a ringing sound, or gentle music at your location. Anyone who can hear when you cast a spell become aware of you and learn your location. You can still cast spells as normal in an area of silence.
Casting spells doesn't require any particular movements, and doesn't need you to have a free hand.
Casting spells doesn't require any specific material or device (e.g. magic wand), though you are welcome to impose any restrictions on your character that you wish.

## Helplessness

- Has no Actions on its turn
- Can't take Reactions
- Cannot concentrate on anything
- Can move by crawling, up to half its usual speed

### Unconscious

Creatures rendered unconscious are out of the fight; they can recover later at ritual speed, but cannot be revived quickly enough by any means (even healing) to contribute to a fight.
