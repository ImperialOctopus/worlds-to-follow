## Skill Difficulty

The following tables show approximate probabilities for success for a character with +1, +5, or +9 in the relevant skill vs. some suggested passive difficulty values, and for contested rolls between different bonuses.

### Depths 9: Cosmosphere (Creating a New Spell)

In this game, flavour is already free (i.e. spells can do ANYTHING thematically, so long as they hold to the statistics described in the rules). The purpose of Cosmosphere is to allow the creation of spell effects either outside of what is possible with the rules, or to give characters one signature "overpowered" spell.

- Your new spell exists outside of the existing Arts; no spell modifiers apply to it, and it's not affected by abilities like _Spirituality 7: Touch of Otherwhere_.
- As it's not within an Art, you can't lose access to it with _Arcane 9: Paradigm Shift_.

If you choose to base your new spell on an effect that can already be created with magic, use the following guidelines:

- Start with any base spell, and include any applicable modifiers within the same Art (regardless of prerequisites).
- If it requires concentration, then it still does.
- If it has a fixed Mana cost, consider lowering the cost (by 1 or 2).
- If it has a variable Mana cost, consider increasing the base effect (e.g. 2 + Xm becomes 5 + Xm); increasing the scaling may start to break reality at high Mana utilisation.
- Any other sensible numerals within the spell should be increased by ~50%.

If you choose to create an entirely new spell, use the following guidelines:

- Make it cool.
- Your objective is to create a spell that's interesting enough that _when you use it, people remember it_; not to create a spell so powerful that you want use it every turn (if you want power, use the other option!).
- Don't be afraid to come back later and change details if the spell you make isn't a good fit. Your other players are your guinea pigs (...in a good way).

I recommend, regardless of whatever you choose, that you stick to some basic heuristics regarding magic:

- Attacks should only do one damage.
- Persistent effect should require concentration.
- Affecting other creatures against their will should require a contested roll.
