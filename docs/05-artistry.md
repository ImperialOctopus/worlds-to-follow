# Artistry

## Introduction

This is a list of _suggested_ artistries. Artistries will depend on your setting, representing fields of art and craft available to study in that setting. For example, characters in a setting which hasn't invented metalworking won't be able to learn Smithing.

Artistries most straightforwardly give your character things to do during downtime, but you should consider how your skills might be applied to unusual situations. Some examples of unusual uses for each Artistry have been provided, but these are only guidelines — you can propose using an Artistry in any situation you think it applies, and your Arbiter can decline to use any of my suggestions if they wish.

## Rolling Skills

When you try and do something covered by an Artistry you're proficient with, most of the time there is no need to roll. If you've gone through culinary school, or spent years training as a painter, you're going to succeed almost all of the time when you attempt things you've practiced. Producing something of unusual quality is generally going to require more time, rather than more dice luck.

When you're applying your Artistry to new situations, however, skill rolls will generally be called for. Do not feel limited to using only Expression for these. Your Artistry proficiency _allows you to try_, but your scores in skills relevant to _how you're trying_ are important for success.

As Arbiter, if you think a character's Artistry proficiency is helpful to something they're doing, you should either reduce the roll's difficulty or provide some other benefit to using the Artistry (e.g. more information than they could have gotten with the skill roll alone).

For example, a character with proficiency in Jewellery examining a lump of amber would trivially notice details in its appearance that an untrained character may only see with a very high Precision roll; instead, you might ask for an Arcane roll for them to notice signs of a hidden magical _trace_. A chararacter using their Leatherworking proficiency to improvise restraints for an apprehended suspect may only have to roll World vs. 9, rather than World vs. 15.
